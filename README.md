Script.py implements Power Analysis by using the characteristics of the optical beam and the space channel, plots the Transmitted Output Power vs Received Input Power for a fixed distance 
between transmitter and receiver for Tx Power Range: 100 mW to 1 W (in 10 mW steps) and Fixed Distance: 200 km, 400 km, 600 km, 800 km, 1000 km.

Sript1.py implements BER vs SNR for OOK Modulation, Plots Bit Error Rate (BER) vs Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation; for Tx Power Range: 200 mW; 
at Fixed Distance: 200 km, 400 km, 600 km, 800 km, 1000 km for SNR Ranges: -2 dB to 7 dB.

Script3.py characterizes a Gaussian Optical Beam in Outer Space.
